## Game Name: reBlock

### High Concept:
A **2D platformer where you have the ability to take blocks from the world and rearrange them in any order** to overcome various obstacles. 
Need a bridge from one platform to another? **Take a bunch of blocks around you and build it yourself.**

### Platform:
The game will be designed to function on **desktops** as the gameplay will be making use of a mouse.

### Story:
You're not sure where or what you are. From the various plantlife growing through the cracks and bits of sun shining through dilapidated
tiles around you, you can only assume this place used to be a laboratory of some kind. The scientists must have forgotten to take you along with them when they left. Only thing to do now is get yourself out of here using the abilities beholden to you: taking specific materials in the world and rearranging them to help you maneuver the abandoned compound.

### Aesthetic:
Much of the surroundings will use **a darker color palette** to get the feeling of solitary exploration across. The game's appearance will be in a **pixelated 8-bit style**. Ambience will be utilized to further the feeling of solitude. Music, if included at all, **will be used to minimum effect** to fully drench the player in the atmosphere. Sound may vary by player location i.e. different footsteps for different floors.

### Gameplay:
The player will be able to take specific blocks from the area around them and place them where they want. I am considering limiting the range to where the player can take or place. More kinds of blocks with different effects will be introduced as the game goes.

The player will use the **WASD** keys to control the character and move them around the field. The **R** key will be used for restarting levels. The **mouse** will be used for taking and placing blocks.

Instructions will be subtly - but still plainly displayed - drawn into environments. If this does not work, then we can use a small box
positioned above the player character that fades in anytime new instructions are available.

Situations will start out simple. Introduction to the player's powers could be the need of a staircase in order to reach a high platform.
Then move to creating bridges. Then limit how many blocks are available for building. Then introduce new kinds of blocks. Start introducing
**new threats**, like enemies that might have projectiles, or spikes.

#### Other:
Flash games on various websites like Newgrounds and ArmorGames have always been part of my childhood and inspire much of my view on games today. I'm excited to take this opportunity and try to recreate the feeling of playing a game in a browser all those years ago, while still being able to make it feel unique and personalize it with my own designs and ideas.
